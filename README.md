•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

	For the weight tracker, I was tasked to create an app that will allow the user to set a goal 	weight and to keep a log of daily weight. The app was to use a SQL database that would store  	weight data and login information.
  
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To be successful, the app UI needed to include a login screen that registers the username and password that will allow the user to login. The main page showed the users goal weight and weight data in a list format by reading the data from the SQL database. The user would have the ability to use the CRUD functionality to modify the data. To allow this the UI needed to be designed by adding buttons to add to the list and by clicking the list item, the user would be able to edit and delete the entry. The UI was designed to be very easy to use with the data base seemingly to update the data in real time.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

	When developing code for application I learned a big lesson in this class. I thought I had a good 	plan in place to write the code. I work full time, so I end up doing most of my work over the 	weekend, so help is very limited and drop-in tutoring service is useless. This time it fell apart and 	ran in to major problems. Although this time things did not go well, I can learn from this. The 	biggest lesson I learned is do not become over confidant. I did not leave my self any wiggle room 	and ended up paying for it in the end. Always add more time because you never know when it 	will take you four hours to find one bug. For me it was missing space. One more thing that 
  
•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

	When testing my code,  I learned is work on small sections and make sure that it works before 		you move on. I had just sat down and started to write code and ended up with broken program 	that I ended up just trashing and restarting losing many hours of work.
  
•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

	When I was setting up the goal weight, I was using a similar process as the daily weight list. I ran 	into an issue of setting up the initial entry. I could not figure out how to just set up on entry. 	What I did to work around this was to add a button to allow the user to add an entry. The side 	effect of this it allowed the user to create more than one goal entry.
  
•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

	I believe my UI was my strong suit with this project. I felt that it was successful due to allowing 	the user to intuit the use of the app.
